Be sure to define a "discord_bot_token" variable and "sepush_token" variable in a file called "KEYS.py" in the root directory.

Use loadsheddingbot.service to use the bot as a service

Make sure the code is run from /home/pi/DiscordLoadsheddingBot
If not, change the "WorkingDirectory" variable in loadsheddingbot.service
